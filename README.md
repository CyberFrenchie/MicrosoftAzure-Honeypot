# MicrosoftAzure-Honeypot

This project involves the creation of a Honey Pot on Microsoft Azure to detect and analyze potential cyber threats. The key components of this project include Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics, Virtual Networks, Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, and the creation of an Attack Map within Sentinel. The goal of this project was to set up an isolated environment to simulate attacks and gain insights into how threat actors may attempt to compromise systems.

Project Overview
In this project, I used a combination of Azure services to deploy and monitor a honey pot that would help in detecting malicious activities. The steps I followed are outlined below.

Components Used:
Microsoft Sentinel: A scalable, cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool used to collect, detect, and respond to threats. Sentinel provides advanced security analytics to monitor the honey pot environment.

Log Analytics: This service was used for analyzing log data generated by the honey pot. It allows detailed queries to identify suspicious activities and events.

Virtual Networks: To create isolated environments for the honey pot, I set up virtual networks within Azure that kept the honey pot separate from production systems.

Resource Groups: Azure Resource Groups were used to logically organize all the resources created for the project, including virtual machines, networks, and storage.

Virtual Machines (VMs): A virtual machine was deployed to act as the honey pot. This VM mimics a vulnerable system to attract attackers, allowing me to study their tactics.

Attack Map in Sentinel: Using Microsoft Sentinel, I created an attack map to visualize real-time threats detected against the honey pot. This map helps in understanding attack patterns and response times.

How I Did It
Set Up the Resource Group: The first step was to create a new resource group in Azure, which provided an organized way to manage and maintain resources like virtual networks, virtual machines, and logs.

Create Virtual Network and VM: I configured a virtual network to isolate the honey pot and created a virtual machine to simulate a vulnerable server.

Configure Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics: I connected Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics to the VM to start collecting data. Sentinel allowed me to set up alerts for unusual activity.

Deploy Honey Pot: Once the environment was set up, I deployed the honey pot on the virtual machine. The machine was intentionally left with known vulnerabilities to attract potential attackers.

Monitor and Analyze Attacks: After the honey pot was running, I monitored traffic and events in Microsoft Sentinel. The logs captured malicious activity, and I used the attack map to visualize attack paths and the overall security status of the honey pot.

Learnings: By analyzing the collected logs and attack map, I was able to observe common attack vectors, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and port scanning. This helped in understanding how cybercriminals may operate and allowed me to refine security strategies for real-world applications.

What I Learned
Attack Detection: I learned how to detect and respond to cyber threats using Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics. The insights provided by Sentinel helped me understand the attackerâ€™s methods.

Incident Response: The ability to track and visualize attack paths in real time allowed me to refine my incident response strategies.

Azure Security Best Practices: Setting up isolated environments with virtual networks and resource groups ensured that the honey pot remained undetected by any external systems.

Understanding Attacker Behavior: The honey pot setup revealed common attack tactics and strategies, such as brute force attacks and exploit attempts, providing valuable data to improve system defenses.

Future Improvements
Enhance Detection Rules: I plan to refine the detection rules in Microsoft Sentinel to capture more advanced threats and improve the accuracy of threat detection.

Expand the Honey Pot: Deploy additional honey pots with different configurations to simulate various attack scenarios and further study attacker behavior.

Automated Response: I aim to implement automated responses to specific threats, such as isolating compromised systems or alerting administrators.

Conclusion
This project provided a hands-on approach to understanding cybersecurity threats and how they can be detected and mitigated using Azure tools like Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics. By deploying a honey pot, I was able to gain valuable insights into how attackers operate and improve my understanding of securing cloud environments.
